//         <h2>What Is Insurance Verification?</h2>
//         <p>
//           Insurance verification is the process of checking a patient’s health
//           insurance coverage, benefits, and eligibility before services are
//           provided. It confirms that the patient’s policy is active, determines
//           what services are covered, and uncovers any requirements (such as
//           pre-authorization, co-pays, deductibles, network restrictions) that
//           could affect billing or reimbursement. For healthcare providers, doing
//           robust insurance verification is a critical first step — it helps
//           ensure that the services delivered are billable and reimbursable, and
//           reduces administrative and financial risk.
