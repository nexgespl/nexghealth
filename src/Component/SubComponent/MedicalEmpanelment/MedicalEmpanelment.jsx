//         <h2>What Is Medical Empanelment?</h2>
//         <p>
//           Medical empanelment refers to the process by which a healthcare
//           provider (hospital, clinic, diagnostic center, etc.) becomes formally
//           recognized and approved by one or more health insurers, Third-Party
//           Administrators (TPAs), or insurance networks — thereby becoming an
//           “empanelled provider.” Once empanelled:{" "}
//           <ul>
//             <li>
//               The provider becomes eligible to offer services to the insurer’s
//               members/beneficiaries under agreed contractual/insurance terms.
//             </li>
//             <li>
//               Patients insured with that insurer can access care at the
//               provider’s facility under cashless or in-network arrangements,
//               reducing upfront cost burden.{" "}
//             </li>
//             <li>
//               The insurer gains a vetted, qualified provider with agreed
//               credentials, while the provider gains access to a broader patient
//               base.
//             </li>
//           </ul>
//           In short — empanelment enables trust, compliance, and seamless
//           coordination between providers, insurers, and patients.
//         </p>
//         <h1>Why Empanelment Matters (For Providers & Patients)</h1>
//         <p>
//           Empanelment delivers multiple benefits:
//           <ul>
//             <li>
//               Access & Cashless Treatment for Patients — When a provider is
//               empanelled, insured patients can receive cashless or in-network
//               treatment, making care more accessible and affordable.{" "}
//             </li>
//             <li>
//               Wider Patient Reach for Providers — Empanelment allows providers
//               to serve members of insurers/payers, increasing patient volume and
//               market reach.{" "}
//             </li>
//             <li>
//               Network-Level Trust & Standards — Insurance networks typically
//               require providers meet certain quality, credentialing, regulatory
//               and infrastructural standards — ensuring care quality and
//               compliance.{" "}
//             </li>
//             <li>
//               Better Coordination & Continuity of Care — Through empanelment,
//               patients get a stable network of care providers tied to their
//               insurance — improving consistency and ease of access.
//             </li>
//             <li>
//               Reduced Administrative Burden for Patients & Providers — With
//               pre-approved facilities, claims, cashless or in-network processing
