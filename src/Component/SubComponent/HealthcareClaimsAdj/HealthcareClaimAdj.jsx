//         <h2>What Is Claim Adjudication in Healthcare</h2>
//         <p>
//           Claims Adjudication (also “claim adjudication”) is the process by
//           which a health insurance payer reviews a medical-claim submitted by a
//           provider and determines whether — and how much — to pay for the
//           services rendered. It involves verifying that the claim is accurate,
//           complete, compliant with policy terms and coding guidelines, and that
//           the services provided were medically necessary. During this process
//           the claim may be fully approved, partially approved (reduced payment),
//           or denied/rejected. Claim adjudication is critical — it is at the core
//           of the payment cycle, affecting when and how providers get reimbursed,
//           and ensuring insurance plans remain stable and properly managed.
//         </p>
//         <h1>Why Effective Claim Adjudication Matters</h1>
//         <ul>
//           <li>
//             Ensures Valid, Compliant Billing — Verifies that codes (e.g. CPT,
//             HCPCS), patient data, service dates, provider credentials, and
//             coverage eligibility are correct. This reduces risk of denials or
//             audits.
//           </li>
//           <li>
//             Protects Against Overpayment & Fraud — By reviewing claims for
//             medical necessity, duplication, policy compliance, and coding
//             accuracy, adjudication helps prevent improper or fraudulent
//             payments.
//           </li>
//           <li>
//             Promotes Fairness & Transparency — Patients, providers, and payers
//             all benefit when adjudication is consistent, timely, and clear —
//             with proper documentation and Explanation of Benefits (EOB).
//           </li>
//           <li>
//             Speeds Up Payment Cycle & Reduces Administrative Burden — When
//             adjudication is smooth and accurate, providers get reimbursed
//             faster, and time-consuming rework or resubmissions are minimized.
//           </li>
//         </ul>
//         <h1>🛠️ Our Claim Adjudication Service — What We Do</h1>

//         <ol>
//           <li>
//             Claim Validation & Coding Review — Check that all patient details,
//             coding (ICD, CPT/HCPCS), documentation, and service data are
//             accurate and compliant with payer and regulatory guidelines.

//           <li>
//             Reporting, Audit Trail & Data Integrity — Maintain detailed logs of
//             adjudication decisions, data validations, overrides or exceptions
//             for audit, compliance, and transparency.

//             handle high volumes efficiently — ideal for large payers, TPAs, or

//           </li>
//         </ol>
//         <h1>How Claim Adjudication Works — Typical Workflow</h1>
//         <ol>
//           <li>
//             1. Claim Submission — Provider submits claim (with service details,
//             patient info, codes) to payer/insurer.
//           </li>
//           <li>
//             2. Pre-Adjudication Review / Eligibility Verification — Check
//             patient insurance status, plan coverage, date-of-service
//             eligibility, prior authorizations or referral requirements.
//           </li>
//           <li>
//             3. Claim Validation & Automated Review — System (or manual process)
//             validates codes, checks for coding / documentation errors, policy
//             compliance, duplicate claims.
//           </li>
//           <li>
//             4. Manual Review (if needed) — For complex, high-value, or flagged
//             claims: human adjudicator reviews medical necessity, completeness,
//             supporting documentation, and policy specifics.
//           </li>
//           <li>
//             5. Reimbursement Decision — Claim is approved, partially approved
//             (adjusted), or denied. Payment amount (if any) is determined based
//             on coverage rules, co-pays/coinsurance, deductibles, provider
//             agreements.
//           </li>
//           <li>
//             6. Explanation & Payment / EOB Generation — Policyholder and
//             provider receive an Explanation of Benefits summarizing what was
//             paid or denied, what remains patient responsibility.
//           </li>
//           <li>
//             7. Post-Adjudication Activities — For denials/partial payments:
//             denial analysis, appeals or resubmission; for approved claims:
//             payment processing and posting.
//           </li>
//         </ol>
