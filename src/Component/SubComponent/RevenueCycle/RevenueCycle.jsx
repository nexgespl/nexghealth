//         <h2>What Is Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)?</h2>
//         <p>
//           Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) is the comprehensive administrative and
//           clinical process that tracks revenue from the moment a patient
//           schedules an appointment until the final payment is collected and
//           reconciled.
//           <br />
//           RCM covers everything from patient registration and insurance
//           verification to coding, claim submission, payment posting, denial
//           management and patient collections.
//           <br />
//           For many healthcare providers, a well-implemented RCM system (or
//           outsourcing RCM services) is critical to ensure timely reimbursements,
//           avoid revenue leakage, and maintain financial stability.
//         </p>
//         <h1>Why RCM Matters — Key Benefits</h1>
//         <ul>
//           <li>
//             Improved Cash Flow & Financial Stability — Efficient RCM expedites
//             claims submission and payment processing, reducing delays and
//             smoothing revenue streams.
//           </li>
//           <li>
//             Reduced Claim Denials and Billing Errors — From accurate patient
//             data entry and coding to clean electronic claim submission, RCM
//             reduces errors that lead to claim denials or delayed payments.
//           </li>
//           <li>
//             Operational Efficiency & Lower Administrative Costs — Automating
//             repetitive tasks (verification, billing, payment posting) reduces
//             administrative burden on staff, freeing them to focus on patient
//             care.
//           </li>
//           <li>
//             Regulatory Compliance & Risk Mitigation — RCM supports adherence to
//             coding standards (ICD-10, CPT/HCPCS), payer requirements, audit
//             readiness, and ensures documentation integrity.
//           </li>
//           <li>
//             Better Patient Experience & Transparency — Transparent billing
//             practices, upfront benefit/coverage verification, and timely
//             statements help reduce patient confusion, improve trust, and support
//             satisfaction.
//           </li>
//           <li>
//             Revenue Optimization & Waste Reduction — RCM helps identify missed
//             charges, under-billing, delayed claims, or lapses in follow-up,
//             helping recapture lost revenue and maximize reimbursements.
//           </li>
//         </ul>
